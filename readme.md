### Motivation

We originally wrote this using node and express (repo can be found [here](https://github.com/brocodedude/MULTI-PACMAN)).

Now I am rewriting it in go because I like go. Also, we get ~10MB portable binary that can run anywhere.

### Stack

Backend: Go

Frontend: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS

Db: SQLite
