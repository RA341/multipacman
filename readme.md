## Project Overview

This project reimagines the classic Pacman game as a modern multiplayer experience, featuring:

- Real-time multiplayer functionality with concurrent users
- Responsive and fluid game mechanics powered by the Flame game engine
- Robust client-server architecture with optimized performance

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework for the game client
- **Flame**: 2D game engine for Flutter, used to implement core game mechanics
- **WebSockets**: For real-time game state synchronization and player interactions

### Backend

- **Go**: High-performance backend server handling game logic and state management
- **gRPC**: For efficient API communication between client and server
- **WebSockets**: For real-time bidirectional communication

## Architecture

The game follows a client-server architecture:

1. **Go Backend**: Manages game state, player connections, and core game logic
2. **Flutter Frontend**: Renders the game UI, processes user inputs, and communicates with the server
3. **WebSockets**: Enable real-time synchronization of game state across all connected players
4. **gRPC**: Provides efficient API communication for non-real-time operations

## Getting Started
